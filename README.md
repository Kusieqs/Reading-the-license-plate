# Project Description of License Plate Recognition using CV2 and EasyOCR:

My project aims to automatically recognize and read license plate numbers from car images. To achieve this, I utilize the OpenCV library (cv2) for image processing and the EasyOCR library for text recognition.

The process of recognizing license plate numbers depends on various factors such as image quality, lighting conditions, viewing angle, image blurriness, etc. Hence, the effectiveness of recognition may vary depending on these factors.

In my project, I have two directories: cars and cars1. In the cars1 directory, there are images of cars where license plates are closer to the ideal orientation and have better quality compared to images in the cars directory. Due to the license plates in the cars1 images being better aligned and more readable, the process of reading license plate numbers from these images may be more successful compared to the images in the cars directory.

In the project, I utilize OpenCV functions for preprocessing images, such as cropping, binarization, blurring, etc., to prepare the images for further text recognition. Then, I use the EasyOCR library, which employs advanced machine learning algorithms for detecting and reading text from images.

It's worth noting that the effectiveness of reading license plate numbers may be variable and depends on different factors as described above. Therefore, it's important to test and adapt the algorithms to specific use case conditions to achieve the best results.
